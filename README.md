# Coursework-planning-and-Time-management-tool

## Problem statement
The proposed solution is to create a web-based application which allows the simple integration of a student portal in a School Information System type of application. This portal will contain different elements which will help the students manage their university duties more efficiently. This application will benefit from an intuitive interface and it will be written using the newest technologies and external libraries to make the development less time-consuming. Also, this software product will be deployed using a web hosting service, eliminating the need for extra installed requirements and facilitating the user tests to be performed in different environments.

## Aims and objectives
The aim is to design a coursework planning and time management tool for the students in order to make them aware of their situation in university.
* To design a coursework planning and time management tool composed by
    - Coursework schedule views
    - Data visualization charts
* To implement the fundamental functionalities for managing users, modules and assignments
    - User authentication
    - Adding a module
    - Adding a coursework
    - Displaying users and their permissions
    - Assign a student/professor to a module

## Deliverables

* Core deliverables of the project
    - A web application tool for coursework planning and time management integrated in a basic School Information System application
    - A database for storing system's data
* Extra deliverables included in the report
    - User evaluation questionnaires
    - UML diagram of database design

## Testing and evaluation
The main method of testing used in this project was user testing. I asked a number of relevant users for permission to test my software using their favourite browser. For this project, the relevant users are students from the School of Computing department from the University of Leeds which are currently in their first, second or third year of study.
